         <p class="font1">The popularity of a commodity or a property in a region is highly influenced by a good number of factors. These factors may be geographical importance, need of the native people, presence of suitable resources and a lot more. And this is exactly how the trend of independent builder floors has caught some great importance in Gurgaon.
<br>
            The need of the people of Gurgaon and how well these independent builder floors fulfill these needs satisfies each other in a fruitful way. Below, we have listed the key reasons behind why builder floors are very popular in Gurgaon and why you should also go for them only.
            <br>
            1- Ownership – Everyone has a dream of having a home of his own. A good and separate nice place which one may proudly call ‘Home’. This dream is not fulfilled by residential complexes in a very fruitful way. You will have a flat in a large residential complex, that is a part of the huge building. But, when you own a floor in an independent builder floor, it is completely your own.</p>
         <p class="font1">2- Maintenance – The independent lifestyle is the new trend in the comfortable living. Everyone wants to keep going ahead having nothing to act as a hurdle in his success. The independent floors in Gurgaon provide the ever-developing population with this sense of continuity as well. If you are a resident of a residential complex, then you have to keep an eye on the maintenance of the flat as well. Every small to big task falls upon your shoulders only. But, in these independent builder floors, the maintenance is a complete responsibility of the builder only. And that’s one of the key reasons of the popularity of independent floors.
            <br>
            3- Affordability – One of the prime or we may say, the foremost factor which influences the decision of home selection is the money factor. Getting a good and modern home under your budget is obviously a treat to have. And that’s why every customer tends to sort the properties based on his budget only.</p>
         <p class="font1">Keeping the money aspect in mind, independent floors are highly affordable. You can easily rent a complete 1 BHK builder floor for less than 25K Rupees a month. Whereas a good flat in a reputed building is tough to find and costs around 30 to 40K Rupees.
<br>
            4- Independence – It is quite evident from the discussion that why the builder floors are generally referred to as ‘independent builder floors’. You get freedom from all aspects of comfort and luxury. In a large residential building, the water and electricity connection of a whole wing is inter-connected and thus, problem in one flat causes problem to all the other residents as well. But in an independent builder floor, each floor is considered as a separate floor in itself. The water and electricity connections are separate and thus, highly convenient in nature.
            <br>
            <br>
            These are a few reasons which account for the numerous utility of builder floors in Gurgaon.</p>
