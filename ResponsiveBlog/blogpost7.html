         <p class="font1">In the last few years of ever-increasing modernization and liberalization, the one type of housing complex that has managed to prove its enormous utility at a very high rate is the builder floor. No matter whether you are at the land owner side, the builder side or the consumer side, you are being benefitted at a very satisfying rate if we are concerned with the dealings of a builder floor.
<br>
            And that’s how you will get a great, independent and easy lifestyle living in a builder floor. Before going deeper into the discussion, let’s firstly clear the basics and get to know what exactly a builder floor is.
            <br>
            <b>What are Builder Floors?</b>
            <br>
            In the most simple words, a set of floors made on an independent piece of land can be termed as a builder floor. A Builder Floor is a low lying residential building set up in a less crowded locality, usually on the outskirts of a city, having two or three independent floors.</p>
         <p class="font1">Whenever a property dealer or even a builder has an independent piece of land in a less populated area, he lends the same to a builder over a legal contract of a few years. The builder, then constructs two or three floor on the land which are rented or sold to the interested consumers. Each floor is independent in an builder floor and is well-equipped with all the modern amenities needed for the day-to-day life of a small family.

            <br><b>A Win-Win Situation for All?</b>
            <br>
            Looking at the basic definition of a builder floor, we are quite clear that there are three most important parties concerned with a builder floor. The first one is the owner of the land, the second is the builder and the third is the consumer who gets possession of a floor in a builder floor. Now, why are we saying that builder floor benefits all its concerned parties at a great extent has a firm reason supporting it.
            <br>
            The owner of the land has to take no tension about the security and loyalty of the tenants. He just has to get a reputed builder for his land, lend him the same over a revised contract and he is free from all the anxiety, related to his land, for five or ten years. Speaking of reputed builders, we have the Laburnum Developers, which is a well setup and reputed organization having many such builders associated with them.
            
            The builder of the builder floor is at a pretty great position as well. After having a well checked and verified piece of land from its owner, he just has to wait for interested buyers for his builder floor. And this task is also well done by the Laburnum Developers. The buyers can select from a variety of builder floors registered with them.
            
            Now, let’s discuss how the actual users are being benefitted from builder floors. This is indeed the part which signifies how builder floors encourage a happy and independent lifestyle.
            <br>
            <b>Epitome of a Happy and Independent Lifestyle</b>
            <br>
            Living in a residential building or apartment is more of a challenge nowadays. You have no sense of privacy, comfort and independence. Firstly, there are a number of criteria that you have to pass to get yourself landed into a residential apartment and then also, there are a plethora of rules to follow.
            
            The builder floors, on the other hand, provide everything that a modern family could ask for. You don’t have to bear the monthly expenses of rent, maintainance etcetera while residing in a builder floor. Each floor is bought by one family and thus, has a complete sense of privacy and security at its par. Plus, you are the owner of your own will and you may live in a builder floor in the most independent way.
            <br>
            These are a few points that tell us how joyful it is to live in a builder floor. Now, let’s discuss what are the things you must consider before acquiring a builder floor, so as to be safe from the fraudsters.
            <br>
           <b> Points of Concern While Buying a Builder Floor</b></p>
            <br>
         <p class="font1">Below are a few things that you must strictly take care of before buying a builder floor:
<br>
            Visit the local registration office and check the title of the building. No residential building, big or small, can be constructed without the proper registration.<br>
            Approved Building Plan and Field Area Ratio need to be double-verified through concerned government authorities.<br>
            You should be patient throughout the dealing. Be calm and check all the steps of processing carefully to be safe.<br>
            Don’t hesitate in getting a opinion or suggestions from other people regarding the property. Your decision should be backed with solid research and approval.<br>
            Complete the Completion and Occupancy Certificate legalities to ensure your water, electricity and other rights on the property.</p>
            <p class="font1">Just keep these things in mind and you will get yourself a great deal.</p>
