         <p class="font1">This might sound crazy, but… I like to practice having ridiculous ideas. I pick a problem or a question and brainstorm absurd solutions. Anything goes, no matter how crazy. This is particularly fun to do with code. And it’s not just for diversion. Practicing absurdity helps solve real-world coding problems. In order to have fun and boost creativity, I asked people on Twitter to share the most absurd way they could think of, to add two numbers in Python without using the + operator.</p>

         <br>

         <p class="font1">I love Luciano’s solution because the foundation is relatively tame. Instead of adding two numbers a and b, he subtracts -a from b. It's the recursion, though, that takes it to the next level. I don't even mind that it only works for integers! It's just beautifully absurd. But what’s the point of writing code like this? For starters, absurdity is fun.</p>

         <br>

         <p class="font1">Happiness and fun are linked to creative output. So coming up with absurd code examples like Luciano’s, is a way to set the stage and prepare your mind for creative work. It gets you into a creative mood. The benefits don’t end there. Absurd code ties concepts together in unusual ways. One way that your brain forms memories is through synaptic plasticity. Synapses — i.e., connections — between neurons are strengthened when they fire together and weakened when they do not. Stronger connections increase the likelihood that specific neural patterns will fire in response to a given stimulus.
            <br>
            In other words:
            <br>
            Writing absurd code strengthens connections between concepts that may not have been strengthened otherwise.
            
            Not all of these connections are useful.
            
            Many will not last. But some will surprise you when they pop back into your thoughts during a serious coding session. Suddenly, you have a new and potentially productive way to approach a problem.
            
            And sometimes you’ll break things in important ways.
            <br>
            Expose weaknesses in systems.
            <br>
            Absurd code comes in many forms.
            <br>
           

            What’s the most absurd way you can think of to print "Hello world"?
            <br>
            Write a program that uses lots of resources but does nothing.
            <br>
            Write a program that compiles and runs in two different programming languages.
            <br>
            Solve a problem with code that really shouldn’t be solved with code.
            <br>
            Write a program that has no infinite loop but will never stop running (It’s OK if it would stop running, but there’s not enough time between now and the heat death of the universe.)
            <br>
            Work on a new prompt once or twice a month.
            <br>
            
            And don’t forget to raise a glass to the joy of absurdity.</p>
