         <p class="font1">Last night I broke my website. Whilst trying to move all my stuff around, I broke dotted squirrel — my long-time non-paywalled mirror of most of the content I publish.
<br>
            And I reached out for tech support.
            <br>
            But my tech support doesn’t work over the weekends.
            <br>
            So now I’m stuck, waiting.
            <br>
            As I wait for a response, I find myself laughing at the sudden lack of things to do — and my other half laughing at me for my inability to solve my own tech problems.
            <br>
            We’re both laughing because the tech person in the house needs tech support.
            
            </p>
            <br>
         <p class="font1">The thing with tech is that the field is big. Not just football field size kind of big — we’re talking hectares of knowledge and different specializations kind of big. We’re talking over a thousand different things you can become an expert. Even in code, there are multiple languages, different frameworks, platforms, backend, frontend, infrastructures, and disciplines. Learning one thing can quickly spawn into another thing.
            <br>
            Over the past 10 years, I’ve probably amassed a large body of knowledge inside my head, along with ways to effectively search for answers to issues and problems. I’ve connected dots and made wonderful apps and solutions with them — along with sketchy wonky things.
            <br>
            But can I fix a printer? Home printer — yes. Your office laser printer that’s giving a 740 error and has a stuck cartridge — no.
            <br>
            I remember being asked to set up a wifi unit once — for a bus — simply because I was in tech and did code things. I looked at the drill set and screws. I laughed and said no — not because I didn’t want to try, but because I didn’t want to start drilling holes in a $300k company vehicle, especially when I’ve never used a drill before.
            
            I don’t do routers. I don’t do networks. I also don’t do security cameras that are connected to a private subnet that’s automated to email pictures.
            
            Yes, there’s ‘code’ involved — but it’s not my kind of code.
            <br>
            So how did I break my website?
            <br>
            I deleted the DNS settings without thinking and didn’t have the backup details for it. Rookie move. My tech support, however, has access to the source information that I don’t.
            
            I know how to fix the issue, but just don’t have access to the details for it.
            
            DNS isn’t really ‘coding’ but to the outside world, all things tech is ‘code’. It’s all the same — and sometimes, it’s just futile to try and explain.
            
            The thing about code…
            The thing with ‘code’ is that you can’t escape other parts of the industry.
            
            You can’t just learn JavaScript and that’s it. You can’t just be an expert in one thing and one thing only. There are ancillaries that come with it if you want to make something useful.
            <br>
            It’s like building a car — there are multiple moving parts that you have to use to assemble the full thing. You might be an expert at making one thing, but you still need knowledge and understanding of how other things work.
            
            Take a tire as an example. Knowing how to make a tire is not enough. You need to know things like the size of the vehicle, the type of expected typical roading usage, and the material types needed for different parts.
            
            You can’t make a tire in isolation if you want it to be useful and up to the requirements.
            <br>
            It’s the same with code. You can’t really learn it in isolation — but you can’t be a grand master at everything either.
            
            There’s no winning at everything. It’s just the way things are.
            <br>
            The Dunning Kruger rollercoaster is the life of a dev
            A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.
            <br>
            It doesn’t matter who we are or what we do, everyone goes through the Dunning-Kruger rollercoaster. In a nutshell, it’s when we’re not experts at something, overestimate our skills, and realize that we’re completely sh*t at it.</p>
            <br>
         <p class="font1">So, do I actually know how to code?
            No. I don’t know how to ‘code’ specifically.
            
            Rather, I know how to make things.
            
            I know how to wire up bits and pieces, and string them together.
            
            I know how to find missing information, and to search and trace bugs. I know how to take apart a problem and bite-size solve them bit by bit.
            
            I know how to step back and look at a problem, boil them down to its essential parts, and turn them into whatever format they need to be in, based on the given time constraints and limitations.
            
            I know how to make adapters and bridges to preexisting legacy apps when it is necessary.
            <br>
            I don’t know everything but I know enough to make myself useful.
            
            I know where and how to find information.
            
            And that’s all it matters.
            <br>
            
            Code is a tool. Infrastructure is a tool. All things digital is a tool.
            
            And when they are combined in a certain way, they solve problems. Sometimes it comes in the form of code. Sometimes it doesn’t.
            <br>
            That’s what the past 10 years have been for me — learning how to use tools in ways that are useful and that’s how it’ll probably be for the next 10 years.</p>
